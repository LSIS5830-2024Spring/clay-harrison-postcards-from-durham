More elaborate postcards featured caricatures, cartoons, slogans and jokes, sometimes of a ribald nature. (Wiki) Leo and Edna Smith lived on East Main, near the old baseball field on Driver. The Hill City Directory lists Mr Smith as an assistant foreman at Golden Belt. The Durham Morning Herald says he ran for City Council in 1955 but hard to tell if his CB radio (an early form of social media?) helped get votes.","KCJ-1481, 2109 E.

coll002,durhampostcard02,"Greetings from Durham, NC","Why do neighborhoods change so quickly in Durham? When the town’s early neighborhoods were first laid out, big houses were built on the hilltops and smaller houses were built down in the creek bottoms. The big houses enjoyed fresh breezes while the smaller houses experienced flooding and smokey air from the factories and mills. Driving along Englewood Ave, you’d go from up in Watts-Hillandale, down to Walltown, up to Trinity Park, down to Ruffin/South Ellerbe, up to Duke Park and down to Avondale... Historically, these neighborhoods were White, Black, White, Black, White, Black...","Greetings From Durham NC, Postcard, neighborhoods, Watts, Hillandale, Walltown, Trinity Park, Ruffin, South Ellerbe, Duke Park, Avondale, White, Black, Englewood Ave","Durham, NC",Postcards from Durham Instagram,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bl5Gb4FAymf/,"July 31st, 2018",coll002,image,.png,en

For Duke’s Indigenous students, the naming raises the opportunity for the University to reckon with its past by supporting its current students... “This report confirms that the United States directly targeted American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children in the pursuit of a policy of cultural assimilation that coincided with Indian territorial dispossession,” wrote Bryan Newland, assistant secretary of Indian Affairs, in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. Twenty students of the Eastern Band of Cherokees attended Trinity College from 1882 to 1887, according to Nora Campbell Chaffin, former Duke history professor, in her book, “Trinity College, 1839-1892.""
