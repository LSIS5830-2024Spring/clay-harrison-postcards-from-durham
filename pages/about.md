## About the Collection

Through my work at the Museum of Durham History, I have gotten to know a Mr. John Schelp, who runs the Postcards from Durham Instagram account, a favorite amongst Durham's history community. As we have practiced metadata development with sample postcards in LSIS 5830, I was inspired to use samples from John's Instagram page. The user base is intended to be Durhamites interested in locating postcard advertisements that have been used to market Durham as an up-and-coming destination. Instagram does not do John's repository much justice, as it can be difficult to view just how many great items that are on the Postcards from Durham page. The collection will consist primarily of images, to demonstrate how metadata could help to make Postcards from Durham an easy-to-access database.
