## About the Collection

Through my work at the Museum of Durham History, I have gotten to know a Mr. John Schelp, who runs the Postcards from Durham Instagram account, a favorite amongst Durham's history community. As we have practiced metadata development with sample postcards in LSIS 5830, I was inspired to use samples from John's Instagram page. The user base is intended to be Durhamites interested in locating postcard advertisements that have been used to market Durham as an up-and-coming destination. Instagram does not do John's repository much justice, as it can be difficult to view just how many great items that are on the Postcards from Durham page. The collection will consist primarily of images, to demonstrate how metadata could help to make Postcards from Durham an easy-to-access database. 



This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
